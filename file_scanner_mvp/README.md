# File Scanner

The **File Scanner** is a versatile, terminal-based Python utility designed to navigate directories, scan text files, and generate structured output reports in multiple formats (`.txt`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.pdf`, `.epub`). Its modular design, robust error handling, and support for customization make it an ideal tool for developers, analysts, and system administrators.

## Features

- **Directory Navigation**:  
  - Browse directories interactively using arrow keys or Vim-like keybindings (`hjkl`).
  - Navigate back to parent directories and confirm selections seamlessly.
  
- **File Scanning**:  
  - Automatically detects text files based on binary content checks.
  - Reads file contents up to a configurable size limit (default: 8KB).
  - Supports metadata extraction (e.g., file size, modification date).

- **Output Generation**:  
  - Generate reports in various formats: `.txt`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.pdf`, `.epub`.
  - Enhanced TXT output with line numbers, metadata, and better formatting.
  - Customizable output templates (e.g., headers, footers).

- **Progress Tracking**:  
  - Real-time progress bar during scanning.
  - Completion confirmation with full output path.

- **Error Handling**:  
  - Prevents empty filenames and checks write permissions before saving.
  - Displays errors clearly in the terminal UI.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:  
  - Works on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and Windows (requires `windows-curses`).
